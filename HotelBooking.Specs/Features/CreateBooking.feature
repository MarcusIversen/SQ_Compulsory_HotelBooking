    Scenario Outline: A hotel room can be booked for a period (start date â€“ end date) in the future
        Given a hotel room is available for the period from "<room_available_start_date>" to "<room_available_end_date>"
        When a user attempts to book the room for the period from "<booking_start_date>" to "<booking_end_date>"
        Then the booking status "IsActive" should be "<is_active>"

        Examples:
          | room_available_start_date | room_available_end_date | booking_start_date | booking_end_date | is_active |
